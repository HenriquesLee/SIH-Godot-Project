Gopal Ji: Lost, are you? I’m Gopal Ji from Kisanpur. Come, let me guide you to our village.
Rishi: Yes please, That'll be really helpful!?
Gopal Ji: This forest, Vanvihar, has a rich history. During the country’s freedom struggle, rebels hid here, leaving behind mysterious writings. We don’t fully understand them, but I’ve heard they hold valuable lessons. Maybe you can uncover their meaning.
Rishi: I’d love to help! Where should I start looking?
Gopal Ji: Start at the lotus farm nearby & Then search the carrot farm and spinach farm nearby to gather more scrolls..
Rishi: What should I look for in these writings?
Gopal Ji: Each scroll holds valuable insights about leadership and the governance. Bring them back here once you’ve read them.
Rishi: Here are the writings I found. They explain a lot about governance and leadership!
Gopal Ji: Fascinating! These writings remind me of something Sushil Ji in Patharwadi once mentioned. He knows much more about such matters.
Gopal Ji: Patharwadi is a woodcraft village to the bottom left of here, surrounded by dark brown mud. You’ll find it easily. Good luck on your journey!
