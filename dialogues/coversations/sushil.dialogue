Sushil Ji: Ah, the wanderer from Kisanpur! Gopal Ji told me about you. I’m Sushil.
Sushil Ji: Before I help, let’s test your knowledge about the President of India. Ready?
Rishi: I’m ready! Ask away.
Sushil Ji: Go to the house at back with a golden chest & axles
Sushil Ji: i think You’ve got a solid grasp of the President’s role. But have you thought about how they’re elected? 
Sushil ji: Or the Vice President’s responsibilities? Fascinating topics, aren’t they?
Rishi: Now that you mention it, I’d like to know more. Where can I learn about them?
Sushil Ji: Unfortunately, I’ve passed my writings to Vandana Devi in Ashaval. She might still have them.
Sushil Ji: Ashaval is to the right, a village shaped like a leaf and known for its medicines. You’ll find Vandana Devi easily—she’s quite knowledgeable. Good luck!
