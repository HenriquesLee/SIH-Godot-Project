Vandana Devi: The forest holds many secrets, wanderer, and patience is the key to understanding them.
Vandana Devi: Sushil Ji mentioned you might visit. While I’d love to help, I passed the writings to my neighbors—they were curious to learn as well.
Rishi: Where can I find these neighbors?
Vandana Devi: You’ll find them nearby. Look for houses with burning furnaces; it’s chilly here, after all.
Rishi: I’ve read the scrolls. They’re packed with knowledge about governance and responsibilities!
Vandana Devi: Ah, you’ve learned much. Governance thrives when people come together for the greater good.
Vandana Devi: I’ve spoken with Ramesh Ji in Kirtinagar; he’ll guide you out of this forest.
Vandana Devi: Kirtinagar lies to the top left, known for its mushroom farms. May your journey be as refreshing as Vanvihar itself!
