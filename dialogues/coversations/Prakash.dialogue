prakash: Welcome to Saraswat City, the hub of knowledge.
prakash: Guruji mentioned your journey, and it’s no coincidence you’ve arrived during our Constitution Awareness Campaign.
prakash: We’re preparing for an important town hall event, where citizens will ask questions about our nation’s governing principles. Someone has to answer them!
Rishi: That sounds fascinating! Count me in.
prakash: That’s the spirit! But let me warn you—only those who truly understand the Constitution can shine at the event.
prakash: Luckily, the answers lie hidden within the city's six ancient libraries. Are you willing to take on this challenge?
Rishi: I’m ready! Where can I find these libraries?
prakash: These libraries, though abandoned, still whisper wisdom to those who seek it.
prakash: The first three will teach you about the Governor’s role, powers, and term. They’re located in the northern part of the city.
Rishi: Got it! I’ll find them.
prakash: Remember, the path to knowledge is never easy, but it’s always rewarding.
prakash: Once you’ve explored these libraries, meet me here. I'll be waiting.
Rishi: See you soon, pakya!
