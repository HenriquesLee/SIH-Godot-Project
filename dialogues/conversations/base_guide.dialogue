Adhyaksh: Welcome, traveler! I’ve been eagerly waiting for you. My name is Adhyaksh, and I am the Guardian of this hub—Unity HQ. And you are?
user: My name is [Player's Name].
Adhyaksh: [Player's Name]! A fine name for someone ready to embark on this journey of exploration and knowledge. Here at Unity HQ, you’ll keep track of everything—your progress, rewards, and achievements. Pretty exciting, isn’t it?
Adhyaksh: Come closer. Let me show you the paths ahead.
user: Wow, this place is huge! Where do I start?
Adhyaksh: Ah, don’t worry. You’re about to see it all! First, let’s look at Law Junction—this is where laws are created, debated, and passed. It’s all about understanding the Legislature, how rules are formed to guide society. You’ll get to see how the Parliament works, and even how the State Assemblies govern at a local level.
Adhyaksh: Next, over there is Admin Arena, where decisions turn into actions. This is where the Executive comes into play. Presidents, Governors, and Ministers—they are the ones running the show, ensuring the laws are carried out and everything functions smoothly.
Adhyaksh: And lastly, there’s Verdict Valley—the land of justice! This is where Judiciary makes sure the laws are applied fairly. From the Supreme Court to the local courts, this is where justice prevails and disputes are resolved.
Adhyaksh: Now, enough from me. Go ahead and meet the Guardians of each of these realms. They’ll guide you on your journey. Choose your path and let the adventure begin!
